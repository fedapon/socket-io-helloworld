# socket-io-chat

This is a proof of concept of a real time chat using websockets with the **socket.io** library.

To try it, you should open at least two browsers with the url shown at the end, select the same room number, and start sending messages.

### Requirements

Node.js v14+

### Installation

First of all, you have to clone the project using:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fedapon/socket-io-helloworld.git
```

Next, we must install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Now, to run the app, you can execute the next script:

```
$ npm run start
```

or, if we want to use nodemon to restart the app on every change, you can use:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Finally the server will be running on http://localhost:3000/.
